#	NODE_ID			(Type: Int)	ID of emulated node. 
#	CONNECTION_ID 		(Type: Int)	Connection ID which defines a specific connection. A node can have many connections simultaneously
#	REMOTE_PORT 		(Type: Int)	Port to connect to on the remote host. Valid for only for a connection 	where the node behaves as a client
#	LOCAL_PORT	  	(Type: Int)	Port to bind to on the host and listen for connections. Valid for only a connection where the node behaves as a server
#	REMOTE_PARTNER_ID 	(Type: Int)	NODE_ID of partner to connect to. Valid only for a connection where the node behaves as a client
#	IS_SERVER		(Type: Boolean)	Indicates if the node should behave as a server for the given connection ID
